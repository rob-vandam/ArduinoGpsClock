# ArduinoGpsClock

This is an Arduino project to drive 6 seven digit displays, driven by a CD4511BE IC. The clock can be used as HH:MM:SS. For Gps I used a NEO-6M breakout.

There is automatic calculation for Summer-/Wintertime based on situtation in the Netherlands (last sunday in March/October). Any contributions for more general user cases are welcome. Feedback too.
